\section{Introduction}
An encyclopedia-like database of anime information, moreso focused on answering questions than showing the user all possibly relevant information.

\section{Objectives}
Make it easy for any user to find information about their favorite anime shows or characters, as well as the people and teams who worked on those shows or characters.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Broad questions: eg. "What is Attack on Titan?" or "Who was Satoshi Kon?"
  \item Narrow questions: eg. "Who did Satoshi Kon work with most frequently?"
  \item Relationship questions: eg. "Has Hideaki Anno worked with anyone who would go on to work on Attack on Titan?"
\end{itemize}

\section{Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most competition is focused on community-created content. Favorites, ratings, reviews, etc. We consider these out of scope.
  \item Most also have a focusing on list-making or cataloging. Eg. "What anime have you seen, what anime have I seen?" This too, is out of scope. Our primary goal is a focus on ease of research.
  \item Most do not make it easy to make claims about the relationships between different anime. For example, if you make a claim like "Studio Trigger is mostly composed of ex-Gainax employees," there is no easy way to look this up. 
  \item Making the above easy is what differentiates our product.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Proposal and Wireframes}

The most straightforward design for this is to simply allow the user to ask these questions directly. If you could just type in "Has Hideaki Anno worked with anyone who would go on to do Attack on Titan?" that would be the dream. However, this problem is very technically difficult. It requires natural language processing for the user query, as well as an understanding of how to traverse the database to look up that information.

Forcing the user to present their question in a specific way, however, works around this issue.

An example of such a constraint is the simple search, which by now, every user is familiar with, and is implemented on all of these sites. In the prior art section, I found all these pages by searching "Liz and the Blue Bird." That search is the designers way of making me present my question a specific way. The broad question is "Tell me everything you know about Liz and the Blue Bird."

Our design thus focuses on presenting the user with a search field, and the ability to add an arbitrary number of search fields.
